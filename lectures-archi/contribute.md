## Train the trainers sessions

**Goal:** The [train the trainers sessions](https://fitness.agroparistech.fr/fitness2/train-the-trainers/) will enable the partners of the FitNESS 2.0 project to become familiar with the digital tools and approaches to be used to update and develop the FitNESS 2.0 platform.

[Session 1](https://fitness.agroparistech.fr/fitness2/train-the-trainers/html-files/index.html)

The objective of this session is to learn how to create content on the web in a quick and easy way. We will first see the basics of content creation with HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Then we will see that it is possible to use the Markdown language which will be easier to handle than HTML or CSS. And finally, we will see Typora which is a practical tool that will allow to write content for the web easily and quickly.



[Session 2](https://fitness.agroparistech.fr/fitness2/train-the-trainers/session-2/index.html)

The second session will show you not only how to create a Word-like document for the web, but a also a Powerpoint-like document without knowledge of HTML 4 or 5, CSS 3 or Javascript. You will have also an overview of a methodology to create your first quiz. All your documents need to be integrated among others, you will then learn [again] how to add metadata within the proposed architecture.
