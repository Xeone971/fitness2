# Upgrade teaching material

## Manifest editor

[The form will help you modify the metadata of your lectures](https://fitness.agroparistech.fr/fitness2/lectures/modifyLectures/modifyLecture.html). The metadata is used to find your lecture when a search is performed on the [FITNESS 2 platform](https://fitness.agroparistech.fr/fitness2/lectures/).

## Quizzes creation

The [quiz creator tool ](https://fitness.agroparistech.fr/fitness2/train-the-trainers/session-2/html-files/quiz-creator-tool.html)is a tool that allows you to create quizzes. We searched and looked at the free tools that existed and that could fit our needs, we did not find a tool flexible enough to meet our needs, so we created one.

Here are the main features of this tool:

- Create questions with a single answer or multiple possible answers
- Create non-linear quizzes
- Create random order for questions and answers
- Display lecture suggestions based on answers
- Add images in questions or answers
- Add images that take up all the space
- Create interactive menu in the form of a quiz
- Open source and free to use
