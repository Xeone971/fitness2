# Vocabulary 6

note: ### Vocabulary 6
### IUPAC Recommendations, Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 84, No. 2, pp. 377–410, 2012
European society of Biomaterials, Conference of Consensus, 3-4 mars 1986, Chester, GB Titre 1 Bioplastic Espace réservé du contenu 2 Generic term for plastics which are either biodegradable or biobased or both.
Biomaterial
Non-living material designed and used to interact with living organisms in a therapeutic context.
European Bioplastics Association: european-bioplastics.com
Bioplastic: Biobased polymer derived from the biomass or issued from monomers derived from the biomass and which, at some stage in its processing into finished products, can be shaped by flow. Note 1: Bioplastic is generally used as the opposite of polymer derived from fossil resources. Note 2: Bioplastic is misleading because it suggests that any polymer derived from the biomass is environmentally friendly. Note 3: The use of the term “bioplastic” is discouraged. Use the expression “biobased polymer”. Note 4: A biobased polymer similar to a petrobased one does not imply any superiority with respect to the environment unless the comparison of respective life cycle assessments is favourable.

# Property “biobased” 7
![Slide7.svg](./src_part1/Slide7.svg  "slide 7 of 37") 

note: Radiocarbon, or carbon 14, is present in all living and recently expired matter Anything that is more than
50,000
years old no longer has carbon 14 One industrial application of radiocarbon dating is ASTM D6866 This discussion is a simplified introduction to radiocarbon dating
. There are exceptions to the theories and relationships introduced below that are beyond the scope of this discussion.
What is Radiocarbon ? Carbon is the basis of life and is present in all living things
.
Radiocarbon, or carbon 14 (also written as 14C), is an isotope of carbon that is unstable and weakly radioactive. Carbon 14 is present in all living things in minute amounts
.
Since it is radioactive, it gradually fades away by radioactive decay until it is all gone. Radiocarbon dating uses carbon 14 to determine the last time something (or someone) was alive. Carbon 14 originates in the upper atmosphere of the earth and is created when neutrons originating from solar radiation bombardment collide with nitrogen in the air. A reaction occurs and a tiny number of these collisions convert nitrogen to carbon 14. This carbon 14 immediately starts to radioactively decay but is constantly being recreated
. This leaves the amount in the air relatively constant.
Radiocarbon immediately reacts with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide (CO2). This carbon dioxide rapidly mixes throughout the atmosphere, where at ground level it is taken in by plants during photosynthesis. This process is constantly ongoing, so that at any point in time the amount of carbon 14 in living plants is the same as the amount of carbon14 in the air around them
.
Living plants are active components of the overall food chain
.
Animals eat plants and/or other animals
; humans eat plants and animals
.
Therefore all living plants, animals, and human beings have the same amount of carbon 14 in their bodies at the same time. Their bodies are said to be in " equilibrium
" with carbon 14 in the air.
Although carbon 14 is radioactively decaying away in the body, it is constantly being replaced by new photosynthesis or the ingestion of food, leaving the amount relatively constant. When a plant stops assimilating carbon dioxide or when an animal or human being stops eating, the ingestion of carbon 14 also stops and the equilibrium is disrupted
.
From that time forward, the only process at work in the body is radioactive decay
.
Eventually, all the carbon 14 in the remains will disappear
. This principle applies equally to a person dying, a corn
stalk being cut down, or to a soybean plant being pulled out of the ground
.
When they stop living, they stop taking in carbon 14 from the air around them, and the amount of carbon 14 in the remains gradually disappears
.
Radiocarbon Dating A radiocarbon dating laboratory is able to measure the amount of carbon 14 remaining in a fossil
. It
then uses this information to determine the last time the fossil was respiring carbon (i.e. eating or photosynthesizing). A radiocarbon dating lab is able to do this using the known
"
half
-life" of carbon 14. The half
-life of carbon 14 is the amount of time it takes for one- half of the original amount to disappear by radioactive decay
. This half
-life is about 5,700 years and means that every
5,700
years the amount of carbon 14 in a fossil is only one- half of what it was
5,700
years ago
. It
also means that if a dead plant has 50% as much carbon 14 in it than in a living plant, the dead plant was alive about 5,700 years ago
.
After
50,000
years, a fossil won't have any radiocarbon left in it
.
Carbon 14 will have all disappeared by radioactive decay
.
When a radiocarbon dating lab doesn't see any carbon 14 in a fossil, it knows the fossil is more than
50,000
years old
.
Petroleum and dinosaur bones are examples of fossil materials that no longer have carbon 14 remaining in them
.
Radiocarbon Dating and ASTM D6866 Radiocarbon dating is applicable to biobased content measurements in manufactured products because they contain some combination of recently living materials and fossil materials
. The standard
developed for this purpose is called ASTM D6866. Recently living materials (the biobased component) have Carbon 14 in them while fossil materials (derived from petroleum) no longer have this weakly radioactive carbon isotope. Thus all the carbon 14 in the product comes from the biobased component. In the case of a product containing both crop-derived and petrochemical components, ASTM D6866 analysis will use the carbon 14 content to calculate how much of the product is derived from plant components vs. the petroleum-derived components. Example: A product that is made of 100% polyethylene that came from petroleum will have a 0% biobased content result via ASTM D6866, whereas a product made of 100% polyethylene derived from plants will have an ASTM D6866 biobased content result of 100%.

### Property “biobased” 7
### Composed or derived in whole or in part of biological products issued from the biomass (including plant, animal, and marine or forestry materials). N.B. A biobased polymer or polymeric device is not necessarily environmentally friendly nor biocompatible nor biodegradable, especially if it is similar to a fossil oil-based polymer.

# Biobased carbon content
![Slide9.svg](./src_part1/Slide9.svg  "slide 9 of 37") 
note: ### Biobased carbon content
### ASTM D6866 – EN 16785 BIOBASED – Materials that are derived in whole or in part from biomass resources are biobased. Biomass resources are organic materials that are available on a renewable or recurring basis such as crop residues, wood residues, grasses, and aquatic plants. Corn ethanol is a well-known example of a biobased material derived from biomass resources. BIOBASED PRODUCT – Any product that contains some amount of biobased material within it is technically a biobased product. The term is typically applied only to materials containing carbon. 9

# Property “biodegradable” 12
![Slide12.svg](./src_part1/Slide12.svg  "slide 12 of 37") 

note: Radiocarbon, or carbon 14, is present in all living and recently expired matter Anything that is more than
50,000
years old no longer has carbon 14 One industrial application of radiocarbon dating is ASTM D6866 This discussion is a simplified introduction to radiocarbon dating
. There are exceptions to the theories and relationships introduced below that are beyond the scope of this discussion.
What is Radiocarbon ? Carbon is the basis of life and is present in all living things
.
Radiocarbon, or carbon 14 (also written as 14C), is an isotope of carbon that is unstable and weakly radioactive. Carbon 14 is present in all living things in minute amounts
.
Since it is radioactive, it gradually fades away by radioactive decay until it is all gone. Radiocarbon dating uses carbon 14 to determine the last time something (or someone) was alive. Carbon 14 originates in the upper atmosphere of the earth and is created when neutrons originating from solar radiation bombardment collide with nitrogen in the air. A reaction occurs and a tiny number of these collisions convert nitrogen to carbon 14. This carbon 14 immediately starts to radioactively decay but is constantly being recreated
. This leaves the amount in the air relatively constant.
Radiocarbon immediately reacts with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide (CO2). This carbon dioxide rapidly mixes throughout the atmosphere, where at ground level it is taken in by plants during photosynthesis. This process is constantly ongoing, so that at any point in time the amount of carbon 14 in living plants is the same as the amount of carbon14 in the air around them
.
Living plants are active components of the overall food chain
.
Animals eat plants and/or other animals
; humans eat plants and animals
.
Therefore all living plants, animals, and human beings have the same amount of carbon 14 in their bodies at the same time. Their bodies are said to be in " equilibrium
" with carbon 14 in the air.
Although carbon 14 is radioactively decaying away in the body, it is constantly being replaced by new photosynthesis or the ingestion of food, leaving the amount relatively constant. When a plant stops assimilating carbon dioxide or when an animal or human being stops eating, the ingestion of carbon 14 also stops and the equilibrium is disrupted
.
From that time forward, the only process at work in the body is radioactive decay
.
Eventually, all the carbon 14 in the remains will disappear
. This principle applies equally to a person dying, a corn
stalk being cut down, or to a soybean plant being pulled out of the ground
.
When they stop living, they stop taking in carbon 14 from the air around them, and the amount of carbon 14 in the remains gradually disappears
.
Radiocarbon Dating A radiocarbon dating laboratory is able to measure the amount of carbon 14 remaining in a fossil
. It
then uses this information to determine the last time the fossil was respiring carbon (i.e. eating or photosynthesizing). A radiocarbon dating lab is able to do this using the known
"
half
-life" of carbon 14. The half
-life of carbon 14 is the amount of time it takes for one- half of the original amount to disappear by radioactive decay
. This half
-life is about 5,700 years and means that every
5,700
years the amount of carbon 14 in a fossil is only one- half of what it was
5,700
years ago
. It
also means that if a dead plant has 50% as much carbon 14 in it than in a living plant, the dead plant was alive about 5,700 years ago
.
After
50,000
years, a fossil won't have any radiocarbon left in it
.
Carbon 14 will have all disappeared by radioactive decay
.
When a radiocarbon dating lab doesn't see any carbon 14 in a fossil, it knows the fossil is more than
50,000
years old
.
Petroleum and dinosaur bones are examples of fossil materials that no longer have carbon 14 remaining in them
.
Radiocarbon Dating and ASTM D6866 Radiocarbon dating is applicable to biobased content measurements in manufactured products because they contain some combination of recently living materials and fossil materials
. The standard
developed for this purpose is called ASTM D6866. Recently living materials (the biobased component) have Carbon 14 in them while fossil materials (derived from petroleum) no longer have this weakly radioactive carbon isotope. Thus all the carbon 14 in the product comes from the biobased component. In the case of a product containing both crop-derived and petrochemical components, ASTM D6866 analysis will use the carbon 14 content to calculate how much of the product is derived from plant components vs. the petroleum-derived components. Example: A product that is made of 100% polyethylene that came from petroleum will have a 0% biobased content result via ASTM D6866, whereas a product made of 100% polyethylene derived from plants will have an ASTM D6866 biobased content result of 100%.

### Property “biodegradable” 12
### Biodegradable:
Able to be mineralized under the action of microorganism through enzymatic action into CO 2, water, methane (in absence of oxygen), inorganic compounds and biomass under appropriate environmental conditions. N.B. It is always necessary to accompany the indication of biodegradability with an information on the conditions in which the process takes place.
