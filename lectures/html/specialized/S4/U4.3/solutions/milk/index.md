#Solution of Case-study : Milk bottle - Risk assessment
This case study includes data on the bottled milk manufacturing process as well as technical data on the packaging. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of substances from the packaging, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the transfer in the worst case.
The goal is to evaluate the risk of chemical contamination of the food by packaging, using a predictive approach, using a calculation tool: [SFPP3](http://modmol.agroparistech.fr/sfpp3/SFPP3_quick_start/).
