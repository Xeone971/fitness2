#Introduction
The advanced case-studies included in this section are designed to be performed after the case-studie(s) on monolayer (go back to [monolayers](./../../U4.2/casestudies/index.html)) . Calculations are performed on the platform [SFPP3 (Safe Food Packaging Portal version 3)](http://modmol.agroparistech.fr:443/cgi-bin/login.cgi).

 Migration [modeling](https://www.foodpackagingforum.org/food-packaging-health/migration-modeling) encompasses several techniques of mathematical, physical and chemical modeling. An extensive review of the predictive approaches  is available in as a [chapter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691518308196) reproduced [here](../references/index.html). The methodologies can be combined with complementary preventive and optimization approaches to develop safe and environment friendly packaging (see recent [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2019.00349/full)). For compliance testing alone, the EU task-force *TF-MathMod* published a [practical guide](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/practical-guidelines-application-migration-modelling-estimation-specific-migration).

##Case-study 1: Milk bottle - Risk assessment

This case study includes data on the bottled milk manufacturing process as well as technical data on the packaging. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of substances from the packaging, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the transfer in the worst case.

##Case-study 2: Ready-to-eat meal - Risk assessment
This case study includes technical data on the packaging of a heatable cooked dish as well as conservation and usage data. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of  substances from the packaging to the food, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the transfer in the worst case.
