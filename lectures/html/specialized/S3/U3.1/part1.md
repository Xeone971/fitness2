note: Specific and overall migrations are defined in articles 11 and 12 of the EU regulation 10/2011.

For instance, if we consider substances A, B and C used in the composition of the polymers with A and B non volatile and C volatile: Overall migration into simulants takes into account all non-volatile substances that can migrate; therefore in this case substances A and B; Since substances A and C are subject to SML, specific migrations will have to be carried out.

note: For migration tests, Annex III specifies the simulants to be used depending on the food.

There are 6 simulants: A, B, C, D1, D2, E=MPPO= poly(2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide), 
For instance, for margarine, butter and other fats and oils made from water emulsion in oil, we will use the simulant D2 and apply a reduction factor (D reduction factor) of 2 on the obtained migration result.

# Migration of substances from plastic materials

note: For lipophilic substances for which in Annex I, it is indicated in column 7 that the FRF is applicable, the specific migration result can be corrected by the FRF except for infant feeding and for articles of unknown surface; The FRF takes into account a consumption of fat (M F) of 200 g per day and per person instead of 1 000 g per day and per person used in the determination of SML.

For instance, If we obtain a specific migration result of 20 mg/kg for a food containing 50% fat, the FRF to be applied will be 2.5 and the final specific migration result for the substance will be 8 mg/kg.

### Migration of substances from plastic materials FRF: Food Reduction Factor applicable to results of specific migration analysis

# Migration of substances from plastic materials
![Slide27.svg](./src_part1/Slide27.svg  "slide 27 of 73") 

note: To summarize the reduction factors applicable to global and specific migration results, let's start with the simplest case, that of global migration.

In case of overall migration, only the D Reduction factor could be used; if the result obtained is less than the overall migration limit, the plastic material is compliant, if superior of course, non-compliant; 
In case of specific migration, it is a little bit more complicated: The D Reduction factor and the Food reduction factor could be used ! We have to consider the TRF, result of FRF multiplicate by DRF: if the reduction factor is greater than 5, the result will be divided by 5, if the result is less than 5, the result will be divided par TRF ! Then, if the result obtained is less than the specific migration limit, the plastic material will be compliant; in the other case, of course not !

# Screening methods (to verify the compliance)
![Slide28.svg](./src_part1/Slide28.svg  "slide 28 of 73") 

note: There are different methods to verify the SMLs compliance of materials and articles:

The reference method by analyzing the specific migration, of course if the method is validated; By also, screening methods by using the overall migration results but apply to SML value…, by calculating the complete migration with the Qm
…., by modelling the migration; Mai will talk about it in the next session….


They all are accepted by the European Commission

# Stages after the authorization by EC
![Slide39.svg](./src_part1/Slide39.svg  "slide 39 of 73") 

note: Currently, recycling companies operate on the positive opinion of EFSA because the European Commission has not yet validated process authorizations; before taking a decision, the European commission wants to define the admissible rate of incoming materials coming from non-original materials in contact with food; the current rate is 5% and the European Commission is currently auditing recycling companies to adjust this rate. Nevertheless, the steps after EC authorization would be: Registering sites on an EU register w hich does not exist yet Labeling of finished products according to EN iso 14021 Communication of written declarations of conformity to customers

# The founding regulatory texts
![Slide65.svg](./src_part1/Slide65.svg  "slide 65 of 73") 

note: You have a number of regulatory texts in Europe and the USA for food contact material.

1-
In Europe, you currently have the framework regulation that repealed these two directives. As we saw previously, in this framework legislation you have 17 categories of materials (for example, plastics, papers and boards, ceramics, etc.).

2-
In USA, we talk preferably about indirect food additives. that means substances present in a packaging and intended to come into contact with food.

3-
You have the first regulation federal food, drug and cosmetic act, that has been amended by the food additive amendment. This amendement introduces the obligation of a “ Food Additive Petition “ in order to demonstrate the safety of a substance before using it.

4-
The federal food has been also amended by the color additive amendment to introduce color additives in the regulation.

5-
It has also been amended by the Threshold Of Regulation. That means, any “Indirect Food Additive” that migrates into food at a level below the regulatory toxicological threshold may be used subject to compliance with certain conditions as described in CFR21 (Code of Federal Regulation).

6- And the last amendment is the food and drug modernization act. it is a food contact notification (FCN) request submitted to the FDA by a company to use a substance for a specific application.

### The founding regulatory texts
Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act or FFDCA (1938)
Food additive amendment (1958)
Color additive amendment (1960)
Threshold of - Regulation (TOR) amendment (1995)
Food &amp; Drug Modernization Act or FDMA (1997)
Directive n°82/711/EEC (1982)
Regulation EC n°1935/2004 (2004)

# Principles applicable to the safety of materials
![Slide66.svg](./src_part1/Slide66.svg  "slide 66 of 73") 

note: In this slide, you have the principles applicable to the safety of material

1-
In EU you need to respect the inertia principle set out in the framework legislation. That means, the materials shall not transfer their constituents to food in quantities which could: …… …… ……

2-
In addition, no substances are permitted if they have not been assessed

3-
In USA, it is more or less the same, they talk about falsification of food. That means, a material can falsify a food if: it is dangerous for the health; it makes the food unfit for consumption; and if the material releases an additive not approved by FDA.

4-
In addition, the FDA considers the components of materials released in foods as Indirect Food Additives
. And an Indirect Food Additive needs to be safe for the human health under the intended conditions of use.

### Principles applicable to the safety of materials - An indirect food additive is safe if there is reasonable certainty on the part of competent scientists, that the substance released in food has no harmful effect on human health under the intended conditions of use.
Materials shall not transfer their constituents to food in quantities which could: - endanger human health - change the composition of the food - modify the organoleptic properties .
A material can falsify a food if: - it is dangerous - it makes it unfit for consumption - it releases an additive not approved by FDA.
Components of materials released into food are considered by the FDA as indirect food additives.
No substance is permitted if it has not been adequately and sufficiently demonstrated that, when used in accordance with the conditions to be fixed in specific measures, the final material or article satisfies the requirements.

# Rules applicable to risk management
![Slide67.svg](./src_part1/Slide67.svg  "slide 67 of 73") 

note: Here you have the rules applicable to risk management in EU and in USA:

1-
In EU, you have specific regulations for groups of material and theses regulations include information about the: … …. …. …. …

2-
In the USA, components of materials must be approved if they are indirect food additives. you have different ways to approve these components.
-
Via “Food Additive Petition”, to demonstrate the safety of a substance before using it.
-Through a “Food Contact Notification”
which can be submitted to the FDA by a company to use a substance for a specific application.

3- In addition, you have exemptions for use for certain substances that have been granted “Prior Sanction" status or “ Gererally Recognized As Safe“ -------- and also, for substances with a toxicological threshold below the Threshold Of Regulation (that means, it’s is an official exemption of the FDA for a component of a material with an insignificant migration in the food under the toxicological threshold of the regulatory)

4-
You also have physicochemical specifications related to the materials which must be respected.

### Rules applicable to risk management
Components of materials must be approved if they are indirect additives
Specific measures for groups of material may include: - List of authorized substances - Criteria for the purity of substances - Conditions of use - Specific Migration Limit - Overall Migration Limit - Provisions related to oral contact - Rules to check the compliance - Traceability - Labelling - Written declaration of compliance.
Indirect additives may be approved via Food Additive Petition (FAP)
Indirect additives can be approved through Food Contact Notification (FCN)
Exemptions are possible: - Prior Sanctions - Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) - Threshold of - Regulation (TOR)
Specifications are required for materials (physicochemical properties)

# Rules applicable to risk assessment
![Slide68.svg](./src_part1/Slide68.svg  "slide 68 of 73") 

note: In this slide you have the rules applicable to risk assessment in EU and the USA:

1-
in EU, to perform the risk assessment these data are required: ------
------ ------ and the dietary exposure is calculated from the migration on the basis of a daily consumption of 1 kg of packed food per day in contact with 6 dm² of material.

2-
In the USA, more or less the same data are required: ----- ------ ------ And the dietary exposure is calculated from migration and taking into account the CF and the FT:
- The CF (that is defined as the fraction of a person's diet likely to contact a specific food-contact material), so, it’s about the packaging
- The distribution factor (that is defined according to the type of food in contact with the material)

### Rules applicable to risk assessment
The dietary exposure is calculated from the migration on the basis of a daily consumption of 1 kg of packed food per day in contact with 6 dm² of material.
Required data: - identity of the substance - physicochemical properties - description of the application - authorization obtained - migration data - residual content in the material - microbiological properties - toxicological data
Dietary exposure is calculated from migration and taking into account: - the Consumption Factor (CF) - the - Distribution Factor (FT)
Required data: - identity of the substance - manufacturing process - purity, Stability - technological interest and uses - methods of analysis in foods - Estimated Daily Intake (EDI)

# Determination of regulatory compliance of materials
![Slide69.svg](./src_part1/Slide69.svg  "slide 69 of 73") 

note: 1-
in EU the Regulatory compliance is determined by: …… ….. …. …

2- and you have requirements per group of material, it is the case for plastic materials, ceramics ……….. And non-harmonized materials are covered by national legislation which is managed by the mutual recognition legislation 
3-
In the USA, the regulatory compliance of material is determined by the status of individual substances which can be found in the final product.
- And these substances are considered as indirect food additive and covered by one of the following provisions: either by the CFR21, or by the FCN, or GRAS, or TOR and or by the prior sanction - analysis based on solvent extraction or solubility testing in media representing foods can be carried out to demonstrate the compliance of a food contact
material
.

### Determination of regulatory compliance of materials
Required specifications per group of material: - Plastic materials (Reg. EU n°10/2011) - Ceramics (Dir. n°84/500/EEC) - Epoxy derivatives (Reg. EC n°1895/2005) - Regenerate cellulose film (Reg. EC n°2007/42) - Active and intelligent materials (Reg. EU n°450/2009)
Regulatory compliance is determined by: the composition of the material (starting substances, additives, reaction &amp; degradation products, impurities) the results of migration analysis the results of organoleptic tests
An indirect food additive must be covered by one of the following provisions: - a section of CFR 21 - §174 179 (Polymers, papers, adhesives, coatings) - a Food Contact Notification (FCN) - the status of GRAS (CFR 21 §182186) - the status of Prior Sanction (CFR 21 §181) - the - Threshold Of Regulation (TOR)
Regulatory compliance of materials is determined by the status of the individual substances that make up the finished articles.
Analysis can be performed on the finished materials based on solvent extraction or solubility testing in media representing foods.
Non-harmonized material groups are covered by national legislation

# Other provisions
![Slide70.svg](./src_part1/Slide70.svg  "slide 70 of 73") 

note: you have other requirements in the EU and the USA for materials intended to come into contact with food.

1-
in the EU, Materials and finished articles must be manufactured using good practices according to the regulation 2023/2006
- Business operators must exchange information in the supply chain via
written declarations of compliance
- you also have requirements for traceability and labelling
- and the control of the market is done by the national authorities

2-
in USA, Materials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices

- Market control is done by the FDA and its federal agencies

### Other provisions (Documentation, traceability, GMP, market control)

# Article
![Slide71.svg](./src_part1/Slide71.svg  "slide 71 of 73") 

note: Here, it is an Example to show the difference between both legislations.
- You have a bottle of milk of 1
liter
; - This bottle has been conditioned by flash pasteurized at 70°C and kept for 15 days at refrigerated temperature.
- The bottle is composed to 3 layers of HDPE
- you have 2 monomers and one additive to analyse

1-
in the EU, you must use the regulation EU 10/2011 on plastic material
- firstly, we need to know if these substances are authorised in this regulation, the answer is yes
- So, you perform an SM test and OM test according to these conditions to verify the migration limit of these substances in a food simulant

2-
in the USA, you must use the §177.1520 Olefin polymers
- you need to use approved additives, so
you can find this antioxydant (irganox
1076) in the CFR 21§178-2010. It can be used at less than 0,25% in the final product
- you have some specifications to be respected for copolymer of ethylene
octene
- you need also to respect other specifications like the MFI, the density of the material. And in some cases you need to perform an extraction. But in this case we don't need to do an extraction.

3-
so, you can see that the methodological approach is different for both legislations

MFI=Melt flow index

### Example of requirements for plastic packaging CFR 21 §177.1520 Olefin polymers Approved additives : CAS 2082-79-3: CFR 21§178-2010 (&lt; 0,25%) Polymer : Copolymer of ethylene octene of type (a) (4) &gt; 50% ethylene polymer units - Specifications : MFI &lt; 50 g / 10 minutes Density: 0,85 0,92 Extractable fractions (hexane, xylene): N/A Application : groups C à H (CFR 21§176-170) (All conditions except sterilization)
Regulation EU 10/2011 Plastic Materials Authorized substances : Monomers: CAS 74-85-1, CAS 111-66-0 Additive: CAS 2082-79-3 SML (5 min at 70°C + 10 days at 5°C) : CAS 111-66-0: &lt; 15 mg/kg CAS 2082-79-3: &lt; 6 mg/kg OML (10 days at 40°C) : 10 mg/dm² Application : medium term storage at refrigerated temperature included a limited heat treatment
