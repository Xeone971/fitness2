# Introduction
The presented case-studies list practical questions to answer/follow to check the **compliance of food contact materials** according to [EU rules](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials/legislation_en), and more generally to to **evaluate** and **manage** the **risk of migration** of substances from packaging materials into food. The pairs  $(food\;product - material)$  were chosen  sufficiently different to highlight the broad range of storage possible and preparation conditions as well as  the large spectrum of food properties and composition (liquid or solid food). Please consider the described cases studies as instructional and not as a full compliance procedure. This section emphasize, in particular, on the risk of sensory changes induced by the food packaging. Quoting the EU framework regulation [1935/2004/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004R1935&from=fr):

>  [...any material or article intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food must be sufficiently inert to preclude substances from being transferred to food in quantities large enough to endanger human health or to bring about an unacceptable change in the **<u>composition of the food or a deterioration in its organoleptic properties</u>**.]

# Case Studies
## Case-study 1: Packaged Cake
This case study includes data on the process of making a cake, wrapped in plastic film and over-wrapped in a cardboard box. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of substances originating from the packaging,, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the migration value  in the worst case.

## Case-study 2: Milk bottle
This case study includes data on the bottled milk manufacturing process as well as technical data on the packaging. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of substances from the packaging, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the transfer in the worst case.

## Case-study 3: Water bottle
This case study includes data on the production process of bottled mineral water as well as technical data on the packaging. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of substances from the packaging to the food, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the transfer in the worst case.

## Case-study 4: Ready-to-eat meal
This case study includes technical data on the packaging of a heatable cooked dish as well as conservation and usage data. Several questions are inserted into the case study in order to assess the migration risks of  substances from the packaging to the food, to check the compliance of the packaging and to calculate the transfer in the worst case.
