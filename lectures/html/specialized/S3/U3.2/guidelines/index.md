## &#128587;Foreword

The food safety of materials in contact with food is a long-standing concern that dates back to the use of lead for soldering cans in the 19th century. The first harmonized regulations were introduced in Europe in 1976.  The materials and uses have evolved a lot since then.  PVC has disappeared and has been replaced by PET for bottle use, LDPE for cling film, etc. Recycled materials, active and intelligent packaging have been authorized. The demand for **recycled materials**, **biosourced**, **biodegradable** polymer and additives has skyrocketed.  Some materials (paper, cardboard, adhesives, printing ink, etc.) are still not regulated at the European level.

This section lists the applicable and relevant guidance to manage the safety of the main groups of materials in contact with food (as enforced by the EU regulation). The documents are presented for **RISK MANAGEMENT** and NOT for **RISK ASSESSMENT.** Only the document about Non-Intentionally Added Substances (NIAS) recommends best practices for RISK ASSESSMENT.

Attention centres on saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons that are designated MOSH and MOAH. The unsaturated substances (MOAH) are appraised as having mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. The aim is to reduce migration of such substances from the packaging to the foods as far as possible. In response to the question of how the transfer of mineral oil components from cardboard packagings to foods can be minimised, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) points out that the transfer of mineral oil components is influenced not only by their content level in the packaging material, but also by the storage conditions and the nature of the food. <br />“It can be prevented by using virgin fibre-based board and printing inks free of mineral oils, as well as by integrating functional barriers in the packaging structure. Here not only the direct food packaging must be taken into account, but also the possibility of migration from secondary packagings”. According to the third draft.of the Mineral Oil Regulation, specific migration limits of 2 mg/kg for MOSH and 0.5 mg/kg for MOAH are planned. <br />Functional barriers are not all equally effective. Inner packagings made of paper or polyolefins delay migration (lag time), but do not prevent it.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc1.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc1\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc1.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc1\page2.svg" alt="page2" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr></table>

In such cases differences in interpretation have resulted in gaps of harmonisation in how official controls are practically performed.<br />The aim of these guidelines is to ensure that all NRLs can  have the same interpretation of test conditions for specific materials and articles and consequently to give the same advice to National Authorities, Food Inspection services and private compliance laboratories for the practical implementation of official controls for FCM.These guidelines contain practical information that define the parameters that should be used to perform either an overall or a specific migration test according to the nature of the materials and articles to be tested, with a focus on kitchenware. Existing legislation for plastics states that migration test conditions should be selected according to the worst foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article to be tested. The focus on kitchenware was chosen because these articles are typically placed in contact with food in the home and thus the challenge is to define worst foreseeable  conditions of use.<br />These guidelines are intended as a dynamic document and they will  evolve and expand into further editions.

Active packaging is a type of food packaging with an extra function, in addition to that of providing a protective barrier against external influence.

substances into the food or the environment surrounding the food such as preservatives, antioxidants, flavourings, etc.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc6.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc6\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc6.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc6\page2.svg" alt="page2" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc6.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc6\page3.svg" alt="page3" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr></table>

Safe FCM is a complicated area for printing inks, also due to the critical control points in the printing process. It is therefore useful to have more precise check lists on printing inks as guidance to industry and trade, both in the Nordic countries and in EU.One of the goals for this check list is to contribute to the development of more uniform control and requirements for in-house control of FCM, both for products produced in EU and for those in third countries producing FCM for import into EU. A further goal for the project was that check lists could be used as basic guidance for industry, trade and for the food inspectors in the Nordic Countries in their work in controlling in-house declaration of compliance of printing inks and printing processes. The legal requirements in EU with relevance for FCM are found in different regulations and directives. The legal basis for the requirements of declaration of compliance is covered by several part of the EU legislation, like the Food Law,3 the Control regulation,4 the Hygiene regulation5
and the regulation on FCM. This includes the FCM framework regulation no. 1935/2004 and the GMP regulation no. 2023/2006 that covers all types of materials,6 and the production of them. Printing inks used in FCM are regulated by these general requirements and some uses are addressed more specifically, and as there is no specific legislation in the area in EU yet, the responsibility of compliance could benefit from more guidance and risk assessments. With this work on printing inks, the Nordic Food Authorities have continued previous work on elaboration of check lists with the minimum requirements for documentation, especially the declaration of compliance needed to comply with the legal requirements for the in-house documentation of industry and trade.<br />The report has a short introduction to printing processes and some of the critical points in these processes. Such knowledge is regarded as useful in the control and quality assurance.
In-house documentation, including declarations of compliance with the legal requirements, supporting documentation for the declaration and request of other types of information, are based on the assumption, that each link in the chain ensures compliance. The links from producers of chemicals for FCM to the users of the final materials in the food industry and trade rely on each member of the supply chain taking responsibility for providing and communicating information critical to ensuring compliance of the final, packaged foodstuffs or the final material or article sold to the consumers. Furthermore, it is important for the food safety aspects that food industry and also consumers follow the instruction of use on the labels of the FCM sold directly to them. The check lists for the control of compliance for printing inks set a specific frame with minimum requirements to all relevant links in the chain from producers or importers of chemicals and raw materials like additives to the users of the final FCM in the food industry and trade, including intracommunity trade in the EU and import from third countries. The check lists are guidance with the aim to give a starting point for industry and trade when developing their in-house documentation and declaration of compliance. It can be used in present and future work on constructing in-house control documentation or work on improvements of the documentation in order to ensure compliance with the requirements in the legislation, especially the EU regulation no. 1935/2004. Industry and trade would in most cases face supplementary requirements to ensure the technical properties of the printed surfaces, but this type of requirements are not included in this report. It also takes into account the work done in cooperation with the Council of Europe Committee of Experts on Food Contact Materials.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc20.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc20\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc20.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc20\page7.svg" alt="page7" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc20.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc20\page15.svg" alt="page15" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc20.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc20\page23.svg" alt="page23" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc20.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc20\page27.svg" alt="page27" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr>

The Guidance paper covers general and detailed rules on good manufacturing practice. Originally, the intention of this Regulation was to cover especially those materials which are not yet regulated through EU regulations, e.g. printing inks, paper and adhesives. However, in reality it forces all actors in the food contact materials supply chain to make sure that the material or article of concern is processed, controlled and evaluated in such a way, that it is suitable for the intended purpose of food contact. The GMP Regulation can be considered as an implementation regulation to the requirements of Article 3 of the Framework Regulation (No 1935/2004).
The GMP Regulation was published to ensure uniformity amongst Member States with regards to GMP for materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and build a frame for the different industry sector guidelines.<br />
Although the regulation does not refer to any standards, the majority of requirements of the GMP regulation can already be covered through an established and implemented Quality Management System (such as ISO 9001 and equivalent procedures). Therefore, this guidance paper will mainly concentrate on requirements which are either adhesive industry specific or additionally needed to comply with the Regulation (EU) No. 2023/2006.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc12.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc12\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc12.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc12\page2.svg" alt="page2" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr>

Adhesives typically make up less than 5% of the packaging and, for most adhesive applications, direct food contact is not intended1. Depending on the adhesive and application, contact may occur unintentionally at seams and edges, or via migration through the packaging or gas phase due to volatile compounds (vapour phase transfer). Consequently, specific migration of individual compounds is of greater interest than overall migration, as the latter is only a measure of inertness and has no toxicological meaning.<br />Following the requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 1935/2004, the finished food contact material has to be tested and / or evaluated under real use conditions. Testing the adhesive alone can only be considered as a screening tool and should only be used in cases where the worst-case calculation fails or cannot be carried out due to missing information. For more details of how to select a suitable adhesive for application in food contact materials, please consult the FEICA Guidance for a food contact status declaration for adhesives<br />Tests according to the rules of the plastics regulation on the pure adhesive without substrate or the construction material will usually overestimate the migration of constituents into foodstuff, as contributing factors to real migration are not sufficiently considered. Contributing factors can be:<ul><li>Curing times and conditions</li><li>Interaction of adhesive with other FCM layers</li><li>Barrier properties of other FCM layers</li><li>Distribution of constituents within the FCM</li><li>Ratio of adhesive amount to filling good</li></ul></i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc13.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc13\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc13.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc13\page2.svg" alt="page2" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc13.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc13\page3.svg" alt="page3" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr>

FEICA successfully completed a project called ‘MIGRESIVES’ in 2010 to show that the migration of substances from adhesives can be modelled in a similar way than already demonstrated for plastics. The use of modelling can complement or even replace the more time consuming and costly migration testing without compromising the safety of food packaging.

## <section id="paper"></section>PAPER & BOARD MATERIALS | 🌳📰

> The European assaciation of paper industry ([CEPI](https://www.cepi.org/about-cepi/organisation/)) uses the following arguments not to promote specific migration limits already set for plastics, printing inks, adhesives:
>
> -  *"[Paper & board] has low consumer exposure due to the low proportion of all direct contact food packaging, where the main application is contact with dry food."*
> -  *"It has a completely different manufacturing process compared to plastics."*
> - *"Its predominant base polymer is cellulose whose monomer, ß-glucose, has no known adverse health issues."*
> - *"Standard migration test methods used for plastics are not easily applicable or not appropriate for control."*
>
> **&#128587;With the phase-out of single-use plastics and the generalization of recycled materials for primary and secondary packaging, these justifications are becoming more and more disputable**. In particular, the application of specific rules of the 17 groups of materials is not consistent with the risk of cross-mass transfer between materials (cellulosic or not, recycled or not, ternary/secondary and primary layers) and with the risk of delayed food contamination. The guidelines of the  [Nordic  Council](https://www.norden.org/en/information/history-nordic-council) predate the mineral oil crisis and, without being obsolete, does not adequately address the risk of contamination for dry food and cross-contamination.

Whilst it provides a methodology for the demonstration of the suitability of materials and articles for a variety of food contact applications, in itself it has no legal force. Its use is voluntary and it should be noted that other compliance mechanisms exist which may be used separately or in conjunction with this Guideline.<br /> It is the intention that the contents of this document are not fixed and will be updated in accordance with evolving best practice and knowledge of food safety.<h4>Field of application</h4>Paper and board materials and articles are manufactured from cellulose-based natural fibres both bleached and unbleached, from primary and recycled sources. In addition paper and board may contain functional additives and synthetic fibres and also other treatment agents and polymeric binders for organic and inorganic pigments.<br />This Guideline applies to materials and articles constituted of paper and board (excluding non-wovens as defined by ISO 9092) which may comprise one or more layers of fibre and which in their finished state:<ul><li>are intended to be brought into contact with food, or</li><li>are already in contact with food and were intended for that purpose, or</li><li>can reasonably be expected to be brought into contact with food or to transfer their constituents to food under normal or foreseeable conditions of use.</li></ul>The two principal operations in the manufacture of paper and board materials and articles for food contact are normally papermaking and conversion. Most of the specific requirements given in this Guideline will apply at the papermaking stage and will be applicable to paper and board at the completion of that operation.Some requirements are relevant to the converting operation. <br />Paper and board includes mineral coated papers, and the components including polymeric binders in the coating formula are covered by the requirements of this Guideline.<br /> This Guideline may also be applied to paper and board as it is used in other coated and laminated materials, including combinations with plastics, aluminium, and waxes. Specific sections of this Guideline deal with multi-material multi-layer materials involving combinations of paper and board and plastics, filtering and baking applications, and packaging not actually in food contact. </i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc17.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc17\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc17.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc17\page32.svg" alt="page32" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc17.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc17\page33.svg" alt="page33" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc17.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc17\page34.svg" alt="page34" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr>

The document should ensure that the end-product does not constitute a risk to health and by all other means are produced in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. This document may also provide a help to national enforcement authorities and laboratories. As long as it is not transposed into national legislation in the Nordic Countries, the fulfilment of the requirements in this document is not mandatory. The basis for this document is the Council of Europe Resolution on
Paper and Board Materials and Articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs AP (2002) 1. However, legislative, scientific and technological development has been considered after the publication of CoE resolution as well as other development followed in the EU/EEA-area and elsewhere.<br />
<b>Requirements in this document on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), compliance declarations, documentation, traceability, active and intelligent materials and articles and functional barriers are harmonized with Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, and existing measures given under the power of this regulation. According to this document substances used in the production of paper and board used for all food contact applications should have been evaluated by EFSA, BfR or FDA.</b> Specifications and conditions of use  must be respected.Substances may be used as long as they are evaluated
for use in food contact materials or as direct food additives. However, special attention should be paid to Food Consumption Factors e.g. for infants and small children.<br />
This document applies to materials and articles constituted of paper and board which may comprise one or more layer(s) of fibres and are intended to come into contact with or are placed in contact with foodstuffs. Any layer which is composed of paper and board must fulfil the requirements of this document, unless separated from the foodstuffs by a <b>functional barrier</b>.<br />
The fibres of paper and board produced of Nordic tree types, as well as tree types from other parts of the world, are not necessarily toxicologically evaluated, but are in this context generally regarded as safe. Paper and board are manufactured from cellulose-based natural fibres from bleached and unbleached fibre material, including recycled fibres. In addition paper and board may contain several monomer or polymeric additives.<br />
Detailed requirements to compliance declarations and documentation are essential elements in this document, specifying in detail what information shall be kept for inspection by national authorities and what information shall be provided in compliance declarations to the downstream user as a minimum. Requirements on compliance declarations are based on Directive 84/500/EEC including later amendments and Directive 2002/72/EC and amendments. Both are Directives operationalising the obligation in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of issuing compliance declarations.<br />
Specific restrictions are given on finished materials. For virgin fibres tests has to be carried out on heavy metals and PCP. More tests have to be carried out on products made from recycled fibres, dependent on which types of food the materials are intended for contact with. Until new biological tests have been fully accepted and validated for paper the specific requirements for recycled fibres in this document has to be checked
for to ensure safe products.<br />
Foods have been classified into three types, taking into account the nature of the food and the potential for migration in contact with paper and board. The classification laid down in EU Directive 85/572/EEC should be used to determine the food type for individual foodstuffs except where Chapter 6.4 indicates otherwise.<br />
No specific process technologies in connection to the production of recycled fibres is required, only that end product testing is carried out, and restrictions given in relevant tables is respected. However, a short description from the producer of paper and board on which type of process technologies is used shall be included in the documentation.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc19.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc19\page3.svg" alt="page3" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc19.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc19\page5.svg" alt="page5" style="zoom:100%;" /><a href="./doc19.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc19\page27.svg" alt="page27" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc19.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc19\page33.svg" alt="page33" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc19.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc19\page34.svg" alt="page34" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr>

<table border="0px" style="width:100%; table-layout:fixed;"><tr><td>📔<b><big>Food contact materials - metals and alloys</big></b><br />  | 📄66 pages | 🏛️Norden, Copenhagen, 🇩🇰 | 🔉English | <br /><br />🔖<i>Metals and alloys are widely applied as food contact materials, <i>e.g.</i> as process equipment in the food industry and as household utensils. Therefore, they are a potential source of food contamination. Migration of substances from food contact materials to food must not occur in amounts that endanger human health. Relevant for food contact materials made from metals and alloys are the migration (release) of metals, both the main components and foreseen impurities. In-house control based on a declaration of compliance, DoC, and supporting
documentation at the producers and importers are important prerequisites to limit this contamination and to ensure compliance with the legislation. This is considered a general part of quality assurance, even though the European legislation does not specifically require a DoC for metals and alloys used as food contact materials. This Nordic guideline gives a short overview of toxicology, analytical feasibility, legislation and guideline values for release of metals from food contact materials. Therefore, the guideline will be a useful tool for industry and official food inspectors.<br />
The guideline is based on the work done by the Council of Europe, risk assessments from the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, and by the WHO/FAO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, JECFA. Additional sources of information on metals in food are the plastic food contact material (EU regulation 10/2011) and the contaminants legislation

## <section id="nias"></section>NON-INTENTIONALLY ADDED SUBSTANCES (NIAS) | ❓☝️

> The concept of NIAS is evolving progressively from substances "not declared" to "*unknown migrating substance*" or "*substance with unknown origin*".  The complications with NIAS are numerous. Their presence may be certain, but their amount highly random due to the random occurrence and extent of impurities, cross-contamination, reactions of degradation/aging... Absolute identification and quantification requires standards, migration above the limits of detection. Hazard requires the substance to have been evaluated. These conditions are rarely met. As a rule of thumb, it is easier to avoid NIAS when the source is identified, whereas to determine whether the risk may be acceptable.
>
> Several computational approaches have be developed to accelerate the identification of NIAS, the evaluation of risks/hazards based on hypothetical but reasonable chemical structures, the hierarchization of avoiding strategies. The generation of **recycled materials** makes the use of NIAS and undesirable substance management concepts indispensable. This field has evolved with new practices and tools (chemometrics, structure-activity relationships, molecular modeling of migration).

<table border="0px" style="width:100%; table-layout:fixed;"><tr><td>📓<b><big>Guidance on Best Practices on the Risk Assessment of Non-Intentionally Added Substances (NIAS) on Food Contact Materials and Articles</big></b><br />| 📄72 pages | 🏛️Norden, Copenhagen, 🇩🇰 | 🔉English | <br /><br />🔖<h4> Conclusions</h4><i>The risk assessment of FCMs strongly depends on a proper exposure assessment. This is probably the most critical piece of information as the source to which exposure to NIAS occurs is an uncertain step in the risk assessment process. It should be noted, however, that this is an uncertainty which is not specific  for FCM. Accurate exposure information is difficult to obtain for most risk assessments
due to a lack of data on the full production process and the different non-FCM sources of the NIAS.<br />
A risk assessment is typically only performed on NIAS that exceed 10 μg/kg food. This is a regulatory defined LOD which is not based on analytical or toxicological facts. It finds limited use for the risk assessment of NIAS since many NIAS exceed this threshold making risk assessment difficult if not impossible and, on the other hand, a lower concentration of NIAS does not guarantee the absence of concern. A better and more realistic approach is to move to exposure driven risk assessment.<br />
Combination toxicity where two or more substances are present below the LOI but which may have the same target organ or mechanism or mode of action, is in principle, not covered by the NIAS screening approaches. According to two literature studies (EU-SCENIHR, 2012; Boobis et al., 2011) and a publication by Leeman et al. (2013), the health relevance of possible cumulative effects at low (TTC) dose levels is considered to be so low that a need for a correction factor to cover possible cumulative effects is very low to absent. However, for endocrine active substances and genotoxic substances, possible cumulative effects at low dose cannot be excluded (Leeman et al., 2013). The latter can be covered by performing in-vitro bioassays on these end points.<br />
Risk assessment of NIAS should ascertain that these do not contain a potential for genotoxicity. For nonidentified NIAS, it is not possible to determine whether these have a structural alert for genotoxicity. The alternative approach is to perform a genotoxicity in-vitro assay. However, the sensitivity of the applied assay has to be validated towards known FCM related genotoxic substances (e.g. certain primary aromatic amines) and be related to the FCM under investigation. Some promising in-vitro bioassays  are in development that will inform about the mechanism of action of substances (EFSA, 2011). Therefore, genotoxicity testing according to the current acceptable state-of-the-art is being advised.<br />
Although some limitations are described, it should be noted that the risk assessment strategy for unidentified NIAS as described in this report is currently the only approach available for unknown chemicals. The approach should therefore be considered to be state-of-the-art until new and/or more sensitive methods become available. However, since no alternative is available to evaluate these unidentifiable substances, the best one can do today is that described in this guidance.

Few guides deal with materials or their use in combination. The result is a vision that privileges the material to the detriment of the food. The opposite point of view (defending the food) is at the heart of preventive food safety management methods such as HACCP, ISO 22000 and their variants.<br /> The ACTIA guide (<i>in French</i>, not translated) tries to bring this global vision by starting from the phenomena (migration) and by looking at the means of action to minimize the effects according to the European and national (here France) obligations. The point of view addressed in the guide represents the point of view of the food industry, which is the marketer, and therefore responsible vis-à-vis the law. There is no consensus among the materials industry and processors, who invoke limited liability. The complex material flows of packaging materials subject to hazards, recycling cycles and varied supplies greatly complicate the demonstration of compliance. The management of traceability, the implementation of quality assurance procedures and crisis management procedures are essential. .</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc15.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc15\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc15.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc15\page9.svg" alt="page2" style="zoom:100%;" /></a><a href="./doc15.html" title="read the document" target="_readdoc"><img src=".\src_doc15\page15.svg" alt="page2" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr></table>
