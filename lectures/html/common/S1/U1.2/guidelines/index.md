## &#128587;Foreword

The guidelines presented cover the production of raw materials used in food packaging. Currently, the following hot topics are not covered yet by the guidelines (*but are included in lectures*): recycling (♻), reuse (☕,🥤,🍫,🍿), material substitution (♳♴♵♶♷♸♹♺), waste management (🚮), composting (🌳), biodegradation (🌦).

The BREF contains nine chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the pulp, paper and board industry and on the common industrial processes and techniques used within the whole sector. Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 correspond to the following specific sectors: kraft (sulphate) pulping process, sulphite pulping process, mechanical and chemimechanical pulping, processing of paper for recycling with and without deinking, and papermaking and related processes. For each sector, these five chapters provide information and data concerning the applied processes and techniques; the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumption of raw materials, water and energy, and generation of waste; the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations; and the emerging techniques. In Chapter 8 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3(12) of the Directive, are presented for the pulp, paper and board industry. Chapter 9 is dedicated to concluding remarks and recommendations for future work regarding the sector.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc3_part1.html" title="read the document"><img src=".\src_doc3\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr>
