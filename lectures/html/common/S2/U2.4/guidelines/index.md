## &#128587;Foreword

The design of a package must take into account an ever-increasing number of criteria. End-of-life criteria are becoming more and more important. However, they should not replace technical and regulatory specifications. An integrated vision of ecodesign is proposed in these guidelines. The sections will be progressively expanded. Specialized lectures outline research results where ecodesign and safe-by-design approaches are components of computer-aided design👩‍💻👨‍💻.

This process runs through several phases, from the very beginning, which consists in analyzing the demand, to the final feedback that allows thee valuation – and if necessary the optimization – of the solution, without forgetting scaling up to industrial production. This guide was intended to be educational, providing simple tools such as flowcharts and supporting example forms. It is tailored for food industry/agribusiness companies that use packaging,and are willing to adopt design and optimization approaches in the development of a new product or ecodesign.</i></td><td width="30%"><a href="./doc1.html" title="read the document"><img src=".\src_doc1\page1.svg" alt="page1" style="zoom:100%;" /></a></td></tr></table>
