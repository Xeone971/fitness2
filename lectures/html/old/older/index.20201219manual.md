###  2. Decision making and advanced risk management techniques

`The concepts presented in this section uses the dimensionless formulation presented in §4.2.`

####  2.1 Introduction to decision theory and risk management  
Taking decisions under uncertainty may look usually more an art than a science. It is not correct and many results obtained in decision theory can be used in risk management. Very conservative scenarios minimize the risk to claim that a food packaging is safe, when it is not (risk of *first kind* = risk for the consumer). Conversely, they maximize the risk to discard a design, a formulation when it is safe (risk of *second kind* = risk for the supplier). A compromise exists by listing alternative scenarios and by clarifying the sources of uncertainty. A model with too much safety factors will provide unrealistic scenarios and will be unable to rank alternatives (*i.e.* to order scenarios according to the real risk of migration into foods ).   - *<kbd>level intermediate, advanced</kbd>*

Introduction to decision theory and risk management.  
####  2.2 Managing uncertainty by intervals and worst-case scenarios  
For any quantity involved in migration/decision models, it is easy to define a lower and an upper bounds. From these simple considerations, a full monotonic algebra can be derived. As an example: min+min=min, max+max=max.  This lecture presents *physically-inspired* rules to derive similar monotonic scenarios for migration modeling. Two principles i) the mass action law (all transfer are proportional to initial amounts, transferred amounts cannot exceed total migration) and ii) entropy production (maximizing the dispersion of substances with time) are used to build robust scenarios subjected to strong uncertainties on chemical affinities and diffusivities. A methodology for a judicious choice of transport and thermodynamic parameters is exemplified. It is shown that they can orient irreversibly mass transfer in space and in time. <u>The method is accepted for compliance testing</u>.- *<kbd>level advanced</kbd>*

Principles of monotonic (conservative) calculations of migration in presence of uncertainty.
####  2.3 Probabilistic approaches and Bayesian approaches  
Mass transfer equations (transport and boundary conditions) are not linear in time and space. Monotonic properties, shown in 2.2, are used to derive a general methodology to calculate migration and food contamination, when all properties are governed by arbitrary statistics representing either variabilities (initial amounts, thicknesses, contact times, temperature) or uncertainty (diffusivities, chemical affinity). This lecture will enable you to evaluate the probability the contamination of food exceeds a prescribed value. As a result, the calculated distributions can be used for calculating exposure by taking into account (or not) the practices of the consumer and of the supply chain. - *<kbd>level advanced</kbd>*

###  4. Mass transfer in food packaging  
####  4.1 Principles of mass transfer  
Understanding mass transfer (diffusion, sorption/desorption, permeation, migration) is essential to the packaging designer, food and process engineer, risk assessor: Which material to choose (alone or in association)? Which thickness to reach a prescribed thickness? Are my specific migration levels acceptable? The considered solute/migrant/permeant can be a gas or an organic chemical.  - *<kbd>level intermediate</kbd>*

####  4.2 Migration modeling for monomaterials  
Desorption of substances from materials in direct contact with food (of finite volume $V_F$) is coined "migration". This mass transfer is full described in a simple case by the a dimensionless time $Fo=\frac{D_P\times t}{l_p^2}$ , the packaging-to-food volume ratio $L_{PF}=\frac{V_P}{V_F}$ and the partition coefficient $K_{FP}=\frac{C_P^{eq}}{C_P^{eq}}$. This lecture will explain why the migration is so different between fatty and aqueous food products, between a rubber and a glassy material, between a small and large migrant...   - *<kbd>level intermediate</kbd>*

###  5. FMECA applied to food packaging design

`It is recommended to follow sections §1., §2. and §4. before starting by this section.`  

####  5.1 History and principles of FMEA-FMECA  
When something dramatic occurs, there is not one single cause. Failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis is a methodology ($FMECA$) originating from the aeronautic industry to identify and analyze: all potential failure models of the various components of a system, the effects these failures may have on the system, how to avoid the failures and/or to mitigate their effects. The microbiological risks and some physical risks are managed already by the food industry by closely related methods (*e.g.*, HACCP). The $FMECA$ method has been proposed to manage chemical risks associated to migration and cross mass-transfer between materials. The method is compliant with the obligations set in regulations (EC) 2023/2006, 282/2008. They open the way to safe-by-design/preventive approaches of the contamination.    - *<kbd>level intermediate, advanced</kbd>*

####  7.3 Biodegradation and microplastics  

Food packaging accounts for approximately 40% of the uses of plastics, but accounts for more than half of plastic waste. Non-food uses are more durable, while the lifespan of plastic packaging usually does not exceed half a year. The fragmentation of uncollected plastics and their reuse as recycled textile fibers is the main source of microplastics and marine litter. The understanding of biodegradation phenomena is essential to appreciate the impact of plastics on the environment, whether they are biodegradable or not.     - *<kbd>level basic, intermediate</kbd>*

####  7.4 Environmental impact of plastics and recycling  

There is no doubt plastics have changed our society and its habits since their use in the 1950s. Thanks to their versatility and workability, plastics have been used to meet all the needs of human beings, from physiological needs, safety, social belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. Today, pollution by plastics, due to mismanagement of the collection system, is one of the most important global issue facing our society. ==The first part== is devoted to the environmental impact of plastics. Global data on plastics for food packaging are presented as well as the health risk associated with microplastics in soils and oceans. ==The second part== is dedicated to the recycling of plastics. In this section, the actors in the recycling chain and the regulations related to the recycling process, materials and labels are discussed. Next, the concept of recyclability and the differences in recycling terminology (recyclable, renewable, biodegradable, compostable…) are explained. Finally, the main differences between mechanical and chemical recycling are explained.        - *<kbd>level intermediate</kbd>*

Recycling and environmental impact of food packaging.
####  7.5 Safety assessment of recycling processes  

 The directive (EU) 2019/904 requires the phase out of single-use plastics, the generalization of recycling and the reuse of materials in contact with food. The recycling of materials for food contact is authorized in Europe and the USA but under certain conditions. These include the control of deposits, cleaning of polymers, mechanical or chemical recycling, and the implementation of good industrial practices within the framework of regulation (EU) 2023/2006. For health safety reasons, only mechanical recycling of PET is now widespread and complies with clearly defended standards (regulation (EU) 282/2008). This course explains the conditions for the evaluation of recycled PET (rPET): validation of a recycling process and of the utilization of the recycled material.    -*<kbd>level intermediate, advanced</kbd>*

###  8. Forming, filling and sealing processes 

`Please come back regularly, new sections will come in §8.`

####  8.5 Surface treatments and coatings  
Surface treatments increase the surface energy of the packaging surface in order to maximize the contact surface area and the adhesion of adhesives, inks and coatings. Principles and available technologies are reviewed in this lecture.       - *<kbd>level intermediate</kbd>*

####  8.8 Packaging line optimization  
A packaging line is a series system of the stages of the packaging process. For each stage, one or more (parallel) machines are used. These machines frequently have to deal with failures. The machines are put in a sequence and connected by conveyors, which can also serve as buffers. Which tools to optimize the packaging line and assure efficiency? Efficiency is the quality of being efficient, meaning that it produces the expected results without waste. Follow the lecture to learn more.      - *<kbd>level advanced</kbd>*
